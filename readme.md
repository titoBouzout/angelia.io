# angelia.io

WebSockets Server and Client API for Node.js and the browser, with
rooms support.

The goal of this project is to provide a developer friendly API that
just worksâ„¢.

## Installation

`npm install angelia.io`

## Example

```js
// server.js (node.js)

import Server from 'angelia.io/server'

class FancyChat {
	typing(socket, data, callback) {
		console.log('Im', data ? ' typing' : ' not typing')
	}
	theMessage(socket, data, callback) {
		console.log('the message is', data, socket)
		socket.emit('gotIt', 'thanks')
		callback('yes Im sure')
	}
}

Server.on(FancyChat)

class myConnection {
	connect(socket, request) {
		console.log('socket connected', socket)
	}
	disconnect(socket, code, message) {
		console.log('socket disconnected', code, message, socket)
	}
}
Server.on(myConnection)

Server.listen()

// index.js (browser)

import Client from 'angelia.io/client'

const socket = new Client('ws://localhost:3001')

socket.emit('typing', true)

setTimeout(() => {
	socket.emit('typing', false)
	socket.emit('theMessage', 'hi there!', data => {
		console.log('yep', data)
	})
}, 5000)

socket.on('gotIt', message => {
	console.log('Server got it', message)
})
```

### Server Listeners

Listen to an event by creating a class with any name, and give to
methods the name of the things you want to listen to. Then add the
class to the listeners as `Server.on(MyClass)` and you are done.

On user defined listeners, the listener receives three things as sent
by the client: `socket`, `data` and a `callback`; Example:
`class FancyChat { typing(socket, data, callback?) { console.log(socket, data) }}`.

#### List of Predefined `Server` Events

There's a bunch of handy predefined events dispatched

| signature                           | description                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `listen()`                          | when the server is about to listen                                                        |
| `connect(socket, request)`          | when a socket connects                                                                    |
| `disconnect(socket, code, message)` | when a socket gets disconnected                                                           |
| `ping(socket)`                      | when we got an update of the ping for a socket                                            |
| `timeout(socket, delay)`            | when we are about to disconnect a timedout socket, gives the delay in milliseconds        |
| `garbage(socket, data)`             | if the client sends a message that the server has no listener this will be dispatched     |
| `incoming(socket, messages)`        | for debugging: ref to array of incoming messages received before dispatching to listeners |
| `outgoing(socket, messages)`        | for debugging: ref to array of outgoing messages before sending to socket                 |

## Client API (Browser)

### `Client` Options

Arguments for the constructor

```js
const socket = new Client({
	url: 'ws://localhost:3001',
	params: function () {
		return { fast: 'data', test: 'a space' }
	},
	noConnect: true,
})
socket.connect()
```

You may also do like this if you don't need any option

```js
const socket = new Client('ws://localhost:3001')
```

### `Client` API

The client API is similar to regular event handling

| signature                      | kind     | description                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `connected`                    | Boolean  | `true` when the socket is connected else `false`                   |
| `connect()`                    | Function | connects to the server, it auto-connects on disconnection          |
| `disconnect([noReconnect])`    | Function | disconnects from the server, pass `true` to prevent re-connections |
| `on(key, callback)`            | Function | listens for an event, returns an `off` function to stop listening  |
| `emit(key, [value, callback])` | Function | emits data to the server                                           |

#### List of Predefined `Client` Events

As in `socket.on('connect', () => console.log('connect happened!'))`

| signature    | description                                                                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `connect`    | **this happens only once** when we connect to the server, any future connection is a `reconnect`         |
| `reconnect`  | if we were connected at least once, then any re-connection will dispatch this event instead of `connect` |
| `disconnect` | when we disconnect from the server                                                                       |

## Rooms

1. Create a room class that extends `Room`
2. Create a room list that will allow joining sockets
3. Join a socket in a room, a socket may join multiple rooms. Rooms
   are created when the `id` of the room doesn't exists, and deleted
   when there are no sockets in the room and the room doesn't have the
   flag `persistent`

```js
import { Room, Rooms } from 'angelia.io/server'

class GameRoom extends Room {
	persistent = true

	onCreate(socket) {
		console.log('creating room', this.id, socket)
	}
	onDelete(socket) {
		console.log('deleting room', this.id, socket)
	}

	onJoin(socket) {
		console.log('socket joined room', this.id, socket)
		socket.game = this
		this.emit('user joined', 'data here')
	}
	onLeave(socket) {
		console.log('socket left room', this.id, socket)
		socket.game = undefined
		this.emit('user left', 'data here')
	}
}

const games = new Rooms(GameRoom)

class Connection {
	connect(socket) {
		game.join(socket, 'room id here')
		socket.room.id === 'room id here'
		game.leave(socket, 'room id here')

		game.join(socket, 'a different room')
		socket.room.id === 'a different room'
		game.leave(socket, 'a different room')
	}
}

Server.on(Connection)
Server.listen()
```

| `broadcast(socket, key, [value])`     | method  | emits to other sockets in the room               |
| `broadcastOnce(socket, key, [value])` | method  | emits once to other sockets in the room          |
| `id`                                  | any     | the room id                                      |
